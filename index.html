          <p> Most likely, if you have found my site you already know, my name is Andrew Taverna. This page is dedicated to teaching you a bit about myself. Throughout my life I have loved project-based tasks and I’ve always loved the concept of bringing something from a rough sketch to a tangible product. With that in mind, my ideal projects usually involve some form of innovative technology.</p>

          <p>Technology is a critical part in today’s rapidly expanding world and I think my interest stems from the fascination of the term known as ‘globalization’. As I mentioned previously, I enjoy working on innovative projects, and have been for about 8 years. Two of my major projects include being a co-founder at a music tech company based right here in MA and developing my first iPhone App. You can learn more about my current projects by visiting the projects page of my site. My goal as an individual is to be on the forefront of new technology and be part of a team that turns visions into realities by spending much of my day researching and learning about new opportunities.</p>

          <p>When not focused on researching and developing the newest technologies, I spend my free time partaking in activities such as following the Boston Bruins via all their social avenues and watching games.</p>
